Elke De Mulder, Samatha Gummalla, and Michael Hutter. 2019. INVITED:
Protecting RISC-V against Side-Channel Attacks. In Proceedings of The 56th
Annual Design Automation Conference 2019, Las Vegas, NV, USA, June 2–6,
2019 (DAC ’19), 4 pages.

1. Software (SW) implementations of cryptographic algorithms are
vulnerable to Side-channel Analysis (SCA) attacks.

2. Protected SWimplementations typically have a
significant timing and code size overhead as well as a substantially
long development time because hands-on testing the result is crucial.

3. Masking and TI implementation can protect the CPU against power side channel attacks.
