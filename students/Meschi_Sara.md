* **Paper Title**: Nanoparticle diffusion in sheared cellular blood flow
  * Venue : Journal of fluid mechanics
  * Number of pages : 30
  
* **Three outcomes of the paper**:
   
     **1)** The long-time NP diffusion tensor has been described as a function of shear-rate and haematocrit with various power-law scalings.
            
     **2)** It is found that there exists a critical shear rate (~100 s<sup>-1</sup> ) around which the RESID shear-rate dependence changes from linear to nonlinear scale.
     
     **3)** The RBC-NP PPDF analysis suggests a novel approach to visualizing the average RBC morphology in concentrated RBC suspensions subject to different hemorheological conditions.
