### Number of pages: 7
**Outcomes**
1. The ReRAM based PUFs are the most practical choice for authentication and key generation in IoT, as they operate at or below the systemsâ€™ noise level and therefore
are less vulnerable to side channel attacks compared to the alternative memory technologies.
2. A secret key generation scheme for ternary state PUFs that enables reliable reconstruction of the desired secret keys utilizing a serially concatenated BCH-Polar fuzzy extractor.
3. The proposed model can offer a significantly lower probability of mismatch between the original key and the regenerated ones, while a less number of Helper data bits were used to extract the Key when compared to previously proposed fuzzy extractor techniques.
