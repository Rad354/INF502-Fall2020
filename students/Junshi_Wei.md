**Member, IEEE, and Christoph Bregler**

## Out comes:

1.Due to the inevitable presence of measurement noise, missing data and high-dimensional spaces, we argue that NRSFM is best posed as a statistical estimation problem.

2.Extracting 3D shape and motion of nonrigid objects from 2D point track.

3.Estimating time-varying 3D shape from monocular 2D point tracks is inherently underconstrained without prior assumptions.
