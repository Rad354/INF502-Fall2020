Title: **A picoampere current generator for
membrane electroporation**

Venue: **Review of Scientific Instruments**

Pages: 6

Outcomes: 

The instrument was used to induce electroporation in a
bilayer lipid membrane (BLM) and to record the voltage
fluctuations due to the opening and closing of the hydrophilic
pores.

Various control experiments were performed to exclude
the presence of other fluctuation sources: when no membrane
is formed on the hole, with a teflon sheet without hole, with
a hexane thick film and with various RC parallel circuits.
