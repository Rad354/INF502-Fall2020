# 3 Outcomes of the Paper
```
1. The number of peer-reviewed publications regarding forests has increased overall, however the greatest increase has been with regard to North America and Europe regions.
2. While "Ecosystem Management" (defined by provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural) has been negatively impacted by natural disturbances, biological diversity has been positively impacted.
3. Intensifying disturbance under climate change will most likely benefit biological diversity in forest ecosystems, but since it negatively impacts provisioning under ecosystem management, this would have to be handled slowly with good transitions.
