Outcomes: This paper briefly overviews the observation known as Peto’s Paradox, highlighting our current understanding and providing potential research applications of this biological anomaly. Named after epidemiologist Richard Peto, Peto’s Paradox describes the lack of correlation between cancer risk and the combination of an organism’s lifespan and number of cells. (1) After examining the fossil record, researchers found one instance of metastatic cancer in hadrosaurs, which were elephant sized, non-avian dinosaurs. (2) Further investigation found that hadrosaurs likely experienced very high rates of cancer compared to all other dinosaurs, which could be explained by disparities in life history traits and lack of sufficient DNA repair mechanisms. (3) Investigations into the various mechanisms of cancer suppression of large, long-lived animals could hold key approaches to the battle against cancer while offering another reason to protect Earth’s biodiversity.
