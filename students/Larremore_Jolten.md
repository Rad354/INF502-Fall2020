**Three Outcomes of the Paper:**
1. Although human cancer genes are generally nor conserved at a nucleotide level, the experiement propose that they were present in the common ancestor of eutherians.
    * Eutherians include all placental mammals, and excludes the marsupials and monotremes.
2. The Naked Mole-Rat (*Heterocephalus glaber*) and other extremely long-lived mammals contained more copies of caretaker genes in their genomes
    * This suggests that the maintenance of genome integrity is an important form of cancer prevention in long-lived species.
    * Also, there's a postive correlation between a species' cancer gene copy number and it's longevity, but not body size.
      * This contradicts Peto's Paradox, which states that animals that are larger **and*** long-living actually get less cancer than humans, even though greater size and longevity requires more complex genetic controls over cell proliferation.
3. Longevity had a fascinating, unique effect on the number of cancer gene copies in the mammalian genome
    * This association is observed in both germline and somatic tumor suppressor genes.
      * This indicates that natural selection has acted to suppress both hereditary and sporadic cancers.
