**Outcomes:**  
1.The usage of ternary states can strengthen PUFs generated by memory devices, blanking all marginal states, delivering solid hardware cryptographic keys, and low CRPs matching errors during authentication cycles.  
2.Resistive RAM is an attractive memory technology fordesigning secure applications, encrypted PUFs, and RNGs. It is lower power, faster, and less sensitive to side channel attack than flash memory.   
3.The parameter controlling the programming threshold voltages of the cells has the potential to generate strong PUF CRPs with matching error rates in the 8ppm range. This is expected to improve the reliability of authentication with low FNA, and low FPA
