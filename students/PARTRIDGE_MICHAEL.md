# Outcomes

1. Proof of concept for unequally powered cryptography using a Windows PC for the client and an HPC (high powered computer) for the server.

1. Using noise injection, the threshold for computing power can be moved. If there is no threat, you inject little to no noise, and any computer can find the match. If there is a threat you inject a high amount of noise so that only an HPC can find a match in the limited time.

1. Key fragmentation further increases the capability of the HPC.
