## Homework 1 Part 2

1. Title: *Comparison of Precipitation Forecasts from NOAAâ€™s High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Model with Polarimetric Radar Observations in the San Francisco Bay Area*

2. Venue: *IEEE*

3. Number of pages: 3 pages

4. Outcomes:

    1. This paper presents that monitoring heavy rainfall events and mitigation of their associated negative impacts are critical for protecting life and property in specific region.

    2. This paper proposes the polarization diversity also has the potential to characterize precipitation microphysics through identification of raindrop size distribution and different hydrometeor types.
        
    3. The examples discussed the performance of HRRR model-based precipitation forecasts as a function of forecast lead time will be investigated, which is important for issuing flood watches and warnings.
