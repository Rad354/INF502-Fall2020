## 3 Outcomes of Paper
Reverse Linguistic Stereotyping (RLS), or attributing positive or negative evaluations of speech because of a speaker's 
appearance or other perceptive non-acoustic features, is detectable and common. Results indicate that listener background 
variables moderate RLS, e.g., listeners hear more accented speech when they see a foreign speaker.
Additionally, RLS not only impacts the perception of the social dimensions, but also the comprehension of the speech content.
