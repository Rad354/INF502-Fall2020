**Venue:** International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance (ahead of print version)  
**Pages:** 7  
**Outcomes:**  
1. The Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) does not apropriately map to the Bannister impulse-response/fatigue-fitness model it was derived from  
2. The causal relationship between the ACWR metric and injury occurance has not been established or studied  
3. There is no evidence supporting the use of ACWR in training-load-management systems or for Training recommendations aimed at reducing injury risk
