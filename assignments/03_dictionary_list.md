## Homework 3/4: Dictionaries + Jupyter Introduction

* **INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT**
* **Deadline:** Sept-24th
* **How to submit**:  
* - Submit your Python Notebook files* to your GitHub repository (same used for the other assignments). The files should be called *"Assignment3_Wallets.ipynb"* and *"Assignment3_PTable.ipynb"*. Each file corresponds to one of the exercises below
  - I will evaluate the latest commit before the deadline

**The assignment:**

Read the descriptions below and write algorithms to solve the problems. 

Please provide clear explanations using Markdown cells for each of the code in code cells. Also, break your code in ways that each code block can be explained as an atomic piece. Functions should be in a single box. 

Remember to provide the code chunks in a way that if one executes it top-down everything will work.

I hope you all have fun with this :-)


### Wallets

You are requested to request a user of your application to provide 5 numbers representing the value in cash stored in 5 different wallets.
Your program should store these five values in a list.
When finished, your application should provide the following information:
* "The fattest wallet has $ value in it."
* "The skinniest wallet has $ value in it."
* "All together, these wallets have $ value in them."
* "All together, the total value of these wallets is worth $ dimes"

Please try to think about different functions to complete your work

## Periodic Table 

The Periodic Table of the Elements was developed to organize information about the elements that make up the Universe.
Write a terminal application that lets you enter information about each element in the periodic table.
Make sure you include the following information:
* symbol, name, atomic number, row, and column

Provide a menu of options for users (inputing numbers) to:
1. See all the information that is stored about any element, by entering that element's symbol.
2. Choose a property, and see that property for each element in the table.
3. Enter a new element
4. Change the attributes of an element, by entering the element's symbol.
5. Exit the program

**You can provide a pre-populated dictionary as part of your program, avoiding the need of typing every time**
